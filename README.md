# eBook Library

This app was initially made to scan a copy of books to be used in eReaders, as I had a number of old books whose pages were starting to fall out, but then ended up being a more general eBook library & creator.

## Technology

The app uses React and Vite. Notable technologies used are:

- MUI Component Library
- Tesseract.js - JS OCR Library. Not as accurate as using an AI library that can utilise the GPU, but needed a library that would work in the browser.
- Tiptap - A wysiwyg editor to bring some extra formatting to the ebooks.
